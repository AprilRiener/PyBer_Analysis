# PyBer_Analysis

**Overview of the PyBer Challenge**

In general, analysis is refining data into a format that is easier to comprehend. It provides clarity and simplification to quickly interpret the meaning and potential use it to impact other data. Specifically for this project, I was able to analyze ride sharing data that included multiple types of cities, fare costs, driver availability. The data analysis and visualization products created through this process can support current and future planning decisions for various customers. 

**Results**

The data analysis highlighted the difference in the ride-sharing data among the three types of cities: Urban, Suburban, and Rural. The data was reshaped into categories to quickly allow analysis for individual areas of interests. For example, number of rides per city type, number of drivers per city type, average fare per ride, and average fare per driver. 

**Summary**

This project demonstrated the importance of being able to not only analyze data but also being able to modify the outcomes based on emerging needs or updated requirements. Requirements may be added as you are working through your analysis, or you may want to provide additional visualizations to support your findings. Either way, knowing how to analyze, shape, and reshape data is essential. 

**Software/Technical tools used **

Data Source: city_data.csv, ride_data.csv
Software: Python 3.7.6 and Visual Studio Code 1.58
